## General Summary
This goals of this project is to create an application that runs on both an iOS device as an Android Device using **Xamarin Forms**. This application is intended to use in a work environment. This is one of 3 repositories in this project:

- [IncidentTool-Xamarin]()
- [IncidentTool-Backend](https://github.com/MaartenWarson/IncidentTool-Backend)

**IncidentTool-UWP**
With the UWP application, a coordinator of the company is able to register devices such as printer, coffee machines, beamers, ... This devices will be linked to a few incidents that can happen to it: printer ran out of paper, printer ran out of ink, coffee machine ran out of coffee, ...
The coordinator generates a QR code for each device and places it next/on the device. An employee can scan this QR code with the application created for it. Then he reports the incident that has happened to the coordinator using the application. 
The report from the employee reaches the coordinator, who can fix this problem.
